/*
Exercise 9: Joining elements

1) Use the `join()` method to concatenate the strings in the `foods` array, 
   separated by ' -> '. 

2) Assign the result to a variable called `allFoods`. 

Note: The final result should log as:
'taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger'

/*
Exercise 11: Odd numbers from an array

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array.

2) Push each odd number to a new array named `odds`.

Hint: Initialize the `odds` variable to an empty array before the iteration.

Complete Exercise 11 in the space below:

/*
Exercise 12: FizzBuzz with arrays

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array. 

2. As you loop, sort the numbers into new arrays based on the following rules:

   - Push any number evenly divisible by 3 to an array called `fizz`.
   - Push any number evenly divisible by 5 to an array called `buzz`.
   - Push any number that is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 to an array called
     `fizzbuzz`.

   Note: A single number may meet more than one of the above rules. If it does,
         it should be placed in multiple arrays. For example, the number `15`
         will appear in the `fizz`, `buzz`, and `fizzbuzz` arrays.

Complete Exercise 12 in the space below:
*/
const nums = [100, 5, 23, 15, 21, 72, 9, 45, 66, 7, 81, 90];

/*
Exercise 13: Retrieve the Last Array

1) Assign the last nested array in the `numArrays` below to a variable named
   `numList`. As you do this, also fulfill these goals:

   - Assume you don't know how many nested arrays `numArrays` contains.
   - Do not alter the original `numArrays` array.

Complete Exercise 13 in the space below:
*/

const numArrayS = [
	[100, 5, 23],

/*
Exercise 14: Accessing within nested arrays

1) Retrieve the number `66` from the `numArrays` array. As part of this process
   do not alter the original `numArrays` array.

2) Assign it to a variable called `num`.

Complete Exercise 14 in the space below:
*/

  [100, 5, 23],
  [15, 21, 72, 9],

//asked classmates for help on this i understand it but more practice is needed 
console.log('Exercise 14 result:', num);





/*
Exercise 15: Nested array sum

1) Use nested loops or `forEach()` methods to sum up all numbers within 
   `numArrays` nested arrays.
   
2) Assign the sum to a variable called `total`.

Hint: Be sure to declare and initialize the total variable before the iterations.

Complete Exercise 15 in the space below:
*/

const numArrays = [
  [100, 5, 23],
  [15, 21, 72, 9],
